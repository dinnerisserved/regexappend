A simple Python script that uses regex to find a string and append the result to a url. 

The regex can be changed to suit what you are looking for. 

A simple example can be: 

1) You find a string of text based on the regular expression in this script (or make one yourself)

2) Perform the necesarry operations on it (simple arithmetics)

3) Append the result to your url of choice

4) Open the new url
